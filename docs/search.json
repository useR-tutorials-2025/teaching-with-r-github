We will discuss pedagogy and curriculum design for effectively teaching computing alongside statistical concepts. Participants will explore example in-class activities and assignments that demonstrate the student experience, while discussing strategies for implementing such activities from the instructor perspective. We will also discuss computing infrastructure options that enable students to use R and RStudio from a web browser with minimal set up. Lastly, we will show how instructors can use R and Quarto to make course materials and streamline their workflow in a reproducible way using GitHub. The tutorial will focus on teaching introductory-level undergraduate students with no previous computing experience, but the tutorial content is applicable for instructors teaching high school courses and courses throughout the undergraduate statistics and data science curriculum.",
