## Curriculum guidelines {.midi}

::: incremental
-   Use technology to explore concepts and analyze data. ([GAISE, 2016](https://www.amstat.org/docs/default-source/amstat-documents/gaisecollege_full.pdf))

-   Incorporate software/apps to explore concepts and work with data. ([GAISE revision, in progress](https://community.amstat.org/collegegaiserevision/home))

-   All programs should (a) expose students to technology tools for reproducibility, collaboration, database query, data acquisition, data curation, and data storage; (b) require students to develop fluency in at least one programming language used in data science and encourage learning a second language. ([Two-Year College Data Science Summit, 2018](https://www.amstat.org/education/two-year-college-data-science-summit))

-   The two pillars of computational and statistical thinking should not be taught separately. The balance between them may change from one course to another, but both should be present for the most effective and efficient teaching. ([Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Programs in Data Science, 2014)](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-statistics-060116-053930)

-   **Mixability**: Ability to use base R and other functions within tidyverse syntax

-   **Scalability**: Unified approach that works for data sets from a wide range of types and sizes

-   **User-centered design**: Function interfaces designed with users in mind

-   **Readability**: Interfaces designed to produce readable code

-   **Community**: Large, active, and welcoming community of users and resources

-   **Transferability**: Data manipulation verbs inherit SQL's query syntax

1.  Each variable forms a column.
2.  Each observation forms a row.
3.  Each type of observational unit forms a table.

## The pipe

The **pipe,** `|>`, is used to pass information from one function to another in the tidyverse.

. . .

When reading code aloud in English, say "and then" whenever you see a pipe. Below is a pipeline for a children's poem.\*

## Data: Palmer penguins {.midi}

We will analyze the `penguins` data set from the [**palmerpenguins** R package](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) maintained by Dr. Allison Horst. This data set contains measurements and other characteristics for penguins observed near Palmer Station in Antarctica. The data were originally collected by Dr. Kristen Gorman.

We will use the following variables:

-   `species`: a factor denoting penguin species (Adélie, Chinstrap and Gentoo)
-   `flipper_length_mm`: an integer denoting flipper length (millimeters)
-   `body_mass_g`: an integer denoting body mass (grams)

[Click here](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/penguins.html) for the full codebook.

## `penguins` data frame

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
penguins
```

## Base R: Compute summary statistics

## What about AI? {.midi}

-   We recommend minimal use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) for coding when coding proficiency is a learning objective in an introductory course

-   There are a variety of perspectives on using generative AI tools to teaching coding:

# Infrastructure

## RStudio in the cloud  {.midi}

::: incremental
-   Removes the most common hurdle to get started with computing - installation and configuration
    -   Start using R on Day 1!
-   Actively engage students with all aspects of the course, not just in a computing lab
-   Install R and RStudio on a server and provide access to students:
    -   Centralized [RStudio Server / Posit Workbench](https://posit.co/products/enterprise/workbench/)
    -   Dockerized RStudio Server (what we're using today)
    -   [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud)

-   Customize the pre-installed packages, data sets, etc. for your course

-   Students access their instance of RStudio using institution credentials

## Demo 

-   Open RStudio docker container (see email for URL)

-   Click *File* -\> *New File* -\> *Quarto Document* to make a new Quarto document

-   Parts of a Quarto document:

    -   YAML

    -   Narrative

    -   Code

-   Use Quarto for reproducible in-class activities and assignments

## Discussion

::: question
-   What is something you've seen thus far that you find exciting? Want to learn more about? Would like to incorporate in your teaching?
