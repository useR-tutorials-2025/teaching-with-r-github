## Outline 

-- Why...a course like this should exsist 

-- What...goes into a course like this

-- How...can we run a course like this 

## Programming Language{.smaller} 

![](images/RStudio.png)

-  Freely available

-  High demand in job opportunities

-  Strengths of R align with learning objectives of the course (data visualization, data wranging, function writing, etc.)

-  Integrate seamlessly with GitHub

-  Integrate seamlessly with Quarto 

## GitHub{.smaler} 

![](images/github.png)

-  Competitive skill for students to know 

-  Provide students more responsible collaborative opportunities 

-  Good habits 

-  A plethora of instructor benefits

## My teaching philosphy 

::: highlight
The goal of teaching computing is to provide a toolbox for students to become statistically responsible, literate, and incite excitement around research.

:::

... and there is no reason these types of tools can't/shouldn't be taught early in student's academic careers.


## My teaching philosphy 

When you expose students to these skills early...
. . .

::: incremental
-   Students gain experience using professional computing tools (that they can grow with)

-   Students develop reproducible workflow while learning statistical methods (that they can grow with)

-   Students gain experience working with more complex and realistic data (that they can grow with)

-   Students develop computational thinking and build confidence to handle computational challenges (**that they can grow with**)
:::


## Curriculum guidelines {.midi}

::: incremental
-   Use technology to explore concepts and analyze data. ([GAISE, 2016](https://www.amstat.org/docs/default-source/amstat-documents/gaisecollege_full.pdf))

-   Incorporate software/apps to explore concepts and work with data. ([GAISE revision, in progress](https://community.amstat.org/collegegaiserevision/home))

-   All programs should (a) expose students to technology tools for reproducibility, collaboration, database query, data acquisition, data curation, and data storage; (b) require students to develop fluency in at least one programming language used in data science and encourage learning a second language. ([Two-Year College Data Science Summit, 2018](https://www.amstat.org/education/two-year-college-data-science-summit))

-   The two pillars of computational and statistical thinking should not be taught separately...both should be present for the most effective and efficient teaching. ([Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Programs in Data Science, 2014)](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-statistics-060116-053930)

## Tidyverse in data science workflow{.smaller}

The tidyverse is a collection of R packages designed for data science that share a common philosophy for data manipulation, exploration, and visualization.

![Source: Çetinkaya-Rundel et al. (2022)](images/tidyverse-ds-workflow.png){fig-align="center" width="70%"}

## Pedagogical benefits of the tidyverse {.midi}

-   **Consistency**: Syntax, function interfaces, argument names and order follow patterns

-   **Mixability**: Ability to use base R and other functions within tidyverse syntax

-   **Scalability**: Unified approach that works for data sets from a wide range of types and sizes

-   **User-centered design**: Function interfaces designed with users in mind

-   **Readability**: Interfaces designed to produce readable code

-   **Community**: Large, active, and welcoming community of users and resources

-   **Transferability**: Data manipulation verbs inherit SQL's query syntax

## Base R

```{r}
tapply(
  X      = penguins$flipper_length_mm, 
  INDEX  = penguins$species,           
  FUN    = mean,                       
  na.rm  = TRUE                        
)
```


## Coding with words: Tidyverse

`|>` "and then"

```{webr-r}
# add code here

```


## Coding with words: Tidyverse{.smaller}

```{r}
penguins |>
  group_by(species) |>
  summarise(mean_flip = mean(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = T))
```

# How 

# Infrastructure

## RStudio in the cloud {.midi}


-   Removes the most common hurdle to get started with computing - installation and configuration
    -   Start using R on Day 1!
-   Actively engage students with all aspects of the course, not just in a computing lab
-   Install R and RStudio on a server and provide access to students:
    -   Centralized [RStudio Server / Posit Workbench](https://posit.co/products/enterprise/workbench/)
    -   Dockerized RStudio Server
    -   [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud)

## RStudio in the Cloud 

[Posit Workbench Example](https://rstudio.stat.ncsu.edu/s/9cc5acfc78a319bd2d14f/auth-sign-in)

## NC Share 

Dockerized RStudio Server

[NC Share](https://oit.duke.edu/news/ncshare-network-aims-boost-stem-education-nc/)

[Mark McCahill](https://iss.duke.edu/mark-mccahill): mark.mccahill@duke.edu 

## GitHub 

You can also have Git installed on the server!

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
credentials::ssh_setup_github()

devtools::install_github("r-lib/gert")

usethis::use_git_config(
  user.name = "Elijah Meyer", 
  user.email = "esmeyer2@ncsu.edu"
  )
```

## Other options 

If these types of infrastructure are not available ... 

[Install Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)

[Installing R and RStudio](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html)

... make your own resources for your students! 

# In-the classroom 

## The first day 

```{webr-r}

```

[Posit WorkBench](https://rstudio.stat.ncsu.edu/s/9cc5acfc78a31400e9ea8/)

[Getting set up](https://st295.github.io/st295-sp25/ae-sa/github-config-post.html)

## The next days 

My goal is to get students as much hands on practice as possible in as reproducible of a way as possible.

We can do this with GitHub.

Things that need to be done beforehand 

-- Students must link RStudio with GitHub 

-- You must create a [GitHub Organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations)

-- Students must join the GitHub Organization

Let's Demo this! 

## `ghclass` 

`ghclass` is an R package designed to help instructors manage their courses on GitHub.

## Moving Forward 

-- Assessments and AI 

-- Keeping up with the evolution of Data Science
